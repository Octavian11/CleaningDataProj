# Getting and Cleaning Data : Final Project

## Introduction
 This is my work on the course project for getting and cleaning data on coursera. 

## The Raw Data
 The raw data was obtained from this link [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip]

## Processing applied to Raw Data
R script called run_analysis.R that does the following on the Raw data to clean it up and produce a tidy dataset
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Details about the Tidy set
Details about the raw and tidy data and steps performed are included in the codebook.md file
